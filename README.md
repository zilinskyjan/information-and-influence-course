# Information and Influence: Behavioral Approaches to Political Persuasion

*Description:*

This course explores the science of political persuasion by examining why people believe and act on political messages. Moving beyond traditional models that assume purely rational decision-making, we will apply insights from behavioral economics and social psychology to understand how voters, candidates, and coalitions are influenced.

We will investigate the cognitive shortcuts and systematic biasesâ€”such as motivated reasoning, the availability heuristic, and confirmation bias that shape how people process information. The course will cover key persuasion frameworks, including the Elaboration Likelihood Model (ELM), to analyze when substantive arguments persuade and when peripheral cues like sender identity are more powerful. Through analysis of political stereotypes, messaging strategies, and case studies, students will develop a toolkit for critically evaluating the forces that shape political beliefs and behavior in the modern world.
